  Traditional Style
      package TraditionalTest;

      use Test::Mini 'sugarfree';
      use Test::Mini::Assertions;

      sub setup    { 'This runs before each test...' }
      sub teardown { 'This runs after each test...' }

      sub test_assert { assert 1, 'I should pass' }
      sub test_refute { refute 0, 'I should fail' }
      sub test_skip   { skip "I've got better things to do" }

      testcase SugaryTest {
        setup    { 'This runs before each test...' }
        teardown { 'This runs after each test...' }

        test passes() { assert 1, 'I should pass' }
        test refute() { refute 0, 'I should fail' }
        test skip()   { skip "I've got better things to do" }
      }
